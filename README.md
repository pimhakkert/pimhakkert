### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Programming
My focus lies on back-end programming. I enjoy using PHP for web programming and Java for small applications.
## Learning
I'm currently working on learning the Rust programming language. I have taken an interest in system programming languages and to me it seems like Rust is a good introduction.
## Hobbying
Playing a few games always clears my mind, but sometimes I cannot help myself but pick up a new coding project!
