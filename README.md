### Hello! 👋
My name is Pim Hakkert and I'm an IT enthusiast based in the Netherlands. I currently work at Devoteam Netherlands where I help customers with work in Cloud-, Infra-, and DevOps Engineering. Before that I was a Backend Developer at a SaaS startup.

My interests vary greatly and I will always have something new on my TO-DO list. Technologies that currently interest me outside of work are:
- Kubernetes
- The Rust Programming Language
- AI Agents and the MCP Protocol
- Network Storage Protocols
